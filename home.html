            Whether you have a dog, cat, bird, or anything in between, pet ownership can be an adventure.

            A furry friend can also keep you company through the stress or isolation of the coronavirus pandemic — this
            may
            be why pet adoption and fostering have spiked recently.
        </p>
        <p class="para4">
            While people who adopt an animal usually think they're changing its life for the better, pets have just as
            much
            of a positive impact on the lives of their owners. If you're still on the fence about whether or not you
            should
            adopt a pet, here are 15 reasons why you need one in your life.
            Owning a pet can help reduce stress you're feeling amid the pandemic. According to studies, spending time
            with
            your pet can trigger an increased level of oxytocin, also known as the "love hormone." This is responsible
            for
            the feeling of closeness and increased bonding with your pet. It can also increase your overall mood.
            Your pet could be the perfect conversation starter for your next Zoom call, but owning a pet could also help
            you
            make more friends once social distancing guidelines lift.

            Dogs are naturally curious about their environment, including other dogs and people, and they can be the
            catalyst for social interactions. If you own a dog, you might find strangers approaching you to ask about
            them.

            But other pets like cats can increase your social circle as well. According to a 2015 study conducted in
            Australia and the US, pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood
            than
            those who did not own a pet.

            Pets can be a great way to increase your chances of finding love. According to a survey by Purina, 54
            percent of
            surveyed pet owners said their pets helped them start a conversation with someone they were interested in.
            Nearly two thirds of people said they were likely to date someone who owned a pet, and one in three would
            want
            to meet someone who has pictures of their pet in their online dating profile.
            According to research cited by Psychology Today, couples who own a pet together have lower blood pressure
            and are happier on average than their peers. They also interact more with each other than couples who don't
            own a pet.
